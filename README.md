## Executive Summary

ByteX's sales analysis of 47k records across 2019-2022 shows annual revenue stabilizing at around $3 million, nearing pre-COVID levels, with North America and EMEA contributing 81% of sales. Monitors and AirPods account for 63% of revenue, though customer retention is a concern.
